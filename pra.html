<h2>To create a transition effect, you must specify two things:

        the CSS property you want to add an effect to
        the duration of the effect.
        Note: If the duration part is not specified, the transition will have no effect, because the default value is 0</h2>

<P>CSS Combinators
    A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the selectors.
    
    A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.
    
    There are four different combinators in CSS:
    
    descendant selector (space)
    child selector (>)
    adjacent sibling selector (+)
    general sibling selector (~)
    </P>
    <h2>Q-10</h2>
    <p>A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.

        For example, it can be used to:
        
        Style an element when a user mouses over it
        Style visited and unvisited links differently
        Style an element when it gets focus
        Note: a:hover MUST come after a:link and a:visited in the CSS definition in order to be effective! a:active MUST come after a:hover in the CSS definition in order to be effective! Pseudo-class names are not case-sensitive.Pseudo-classes can be combined with HTML classes:
